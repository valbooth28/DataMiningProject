# Shall We Dance? Using Naive Bayes and Spotify Data to Predict If a Song is a Good Dance Song
Final Project for the RIT 420 Computer Science Course: Intro to Data Mining.

Most contextual information (including why Naiive Bayes was chosen) can be found in the writeup; the implementation
of the model determined by Weka can be found in Scripts. The files were part of a larger app to read Spotify playlists
and identify if the songs in them were danceable or not (with user feedback to test the model) that was almost entirely based 
off of [Paul Lamere's Sort Your Music project](http://sortyourmusic.playlistmachinery.com/).
